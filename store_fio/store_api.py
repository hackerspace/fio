# Modified retry decorator with exponential backoff from PythonDecoratorLibrary
def retry(tries, delay=3, backoff=2, verbose=False):

    Retries a function or method until it returns value.

    Delay sets the initial delay in seconds, and backoff sets the factor by which
    the delay should lengthen after each failure. backoff must be greater than 1,
    or else it isn't really a backoff. tries must be at least 0, and delay
    greater than 0.
